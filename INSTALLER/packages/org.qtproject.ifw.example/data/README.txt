Thank you for installing the Portable Wet Control Lab.

Directions:
    1.) Plug in your Arduino to your computer and then start Main.exe, Test.exe, or Game.exe
    2.) Before attempting to initialize a connection in the program, upload the corresponding Arduino code to the Arduino device (Ex. PWCL_main.ino for Main.exe)
    3.) Then choose the correct COM port from the drop-down list in the program.
    4.) Controller parameters can be changed by typing them in their respective text-box and clicking the 'set' button.
    5.) Data can be exported as an excel File by clicking 'File->Export As Excel File'
    6.) Data is also logged live as csv files as the programm is running, the log files are automatically placed in the log_files directory.

Uninstall:
    Run PWCL_Installer.exe and choose ‘remove all components’.
