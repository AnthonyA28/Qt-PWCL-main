The applications will allow you to control parameters of the process controller.
While connected to the port, data will be logged in the package root folder. (next to the applications, backupFiles, and arduino_programs folders).
Copies of logged data will be placed in the backupFiles folder, so if somehow you lose your work, check there for previously logged data.

If you open a csv file in excel, be ABSOLUTELY SURE to save it as an excel file, thereafter!
